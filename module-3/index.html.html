						The chicken(gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl,a subspecies of the red junglefowl.As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,with a poopulation of more than 19 billion in 2011,there are more chickens in the world than any other species  of bird or domestic animals.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food,consuming both their meat and their eggs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Genetic studies have pointed to multiple meternal origins in southeast-,east-,and south asia,but with the clade found in the americans,europe,the middle east and africa originating in the indian subcontinent.From india,the domesticated chicken was imported to lydia in western asia minor,and to greece by the fifth century BC.Fowl had been known in egypt since the mid-15th century BC,with the "bird that gives birth everyday" having come to egypt from the land between syria and shinar,babylonia,according to the annals of thutmose.

					<h4>Terminology</h4>
					<p>
						In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks,whereas in america,australia and canada they are more commonly called roosters.
						Males less than a year old are cockerels.Castrated roosters are called as capons(surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).Females over a year ald are known as hens and younger females as pullets although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 220 weeks of age.in australia and newzealand(also sometimes in britain),there is a generic term chook to describe all ages and both sexes.The young are called chicks and the meat is called chicken.
					</p>
					<P>
						"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.The species as a whole was then 
						called domestic fowl,or just fowl.This use of "Chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens",sometimes used as a british public house or theatre name,and to name groups of one large and many small rocks and islands in the sea(see for example Hen and Chicken islands).The word "chicken" is sommetimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively,despite the term "hen" for female being in wide circulation.
					</P>
					<p>
						In the Deep South of the united states chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.

                       Roosters can usually be diffentiated from hens by their striking plimage of long flowing tails and shiny,pointed feathers on their necks(hackles)and backs(saddle),which are typicaly of brighter ,bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.However,inn some breeds,such as the sebright chicken,the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers,the same colour as the hen's.The identification can be made by looking at the comb,or eventually from the development of spurs on the males legs(in a few breeds and in certain hybrids,the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour.)Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb,or cockscomb,.and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.Collectively,these and other fleshy protuberance on the head and throat are called caruncles.Both the adult maleand female have the wattles and combs,but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.A muff or breed is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face,givingg the appearance of a beard.Domestic chickens are not capable of flying for short distances,such asover fences or int trees(where they would naturally roost).Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings,but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
